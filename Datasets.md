1.) [https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets)
Covers emissions from large facilities across sectors, including electricity generation.
Includes unit-level and fuel-level emissions, plus crosswalks to other datasets like EIA.
Ideal for U.S.-based analysis with granular facility-level data.

2.) [https://ourworldindata.org/co2-dataset-sources](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-dataset-sources)
Built from the Global Carbon Project and other official sources. 
Offers life-cycle emissions, per capita metrics, and historical trends.
Includes raw data and scripts via GitHub for reproducibility.

3.) [https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/data-catalog](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/data-catalog)
Combines satellite, ground, and model-based data on CO₂ and CH₄. 
Includes urban test beds (e.g., Los Angeles, Northeast Corridor) and flux models.
Excellent for atmospheric concentration and emissions tracking.

4.) [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/electricity/electric-power-operational-data?frequency=monthly&data=ash-content;consumption-for-eg;consumption-for-eg-btu;consumption-uto;consumption-uto-btu;cost;cost-per-btu;generation;heat-content;receipts;receipts-btu;stocks;sulfur-content;total-consumption;total-consumption-btu;&sortColumn=period;&sortDirection=desc)
contains information on cost, letting us cover the overall cost of different energy sources, 

5.) [https://www.energy.gov/data/articles/2025-open-data-plan](https://www.energy.gov/data/articles/2025-open-data-plan)
include breakdowns by energy source (solar, wind, coal, nuclear, etc.), which is crucial for comparing carbon emissions per dollar spent.
You can extract metrics like cost per kWh, lifecycle emissions, and regional availability.

6.) [https://climatetrace.org/data](https://climatetrace.org/data)
You get monthly emissions data broken down by subsector and gas.
You can overlay emissions with economic data or infrastructure maps to visualize carbon hotspots per dollar spent.
Their public API (beta) lets you query emissions by asset, sector, owner, and location.
